          <h5 class="description">
            I'm just a guy from a small cowboy town in Central Oregon, trying to figure out life. I don't think I'd ever figure 
            myself to be in San Francisco working for Google. But, by the grace of God, I'm here and loving life. Although I don't
            think I'll ever consider myself a "city person", I pray I can bring a bit of small town community to wherever I am.

              <p>Technology is my platform. I love technologies, new and old, 
                as they all seem like beatiful works of art to me. Technology 
                is where I feel most equipped to give back to society and help others.</p>

              <p>God is my why. I'm a sinner, just like you. Jesus died for me, 
                and gave me a purpose in my life. Everyday I wake up and have 
                hope that I can be a better person and help make our broken world
                a better place.</p>

              <p>This world is so vast and beautiful. I love admiring the work
                of art our world is, and spending time hunting down the best 
                parts of it with the best people. I'm always ready for the 
                next adventure God has in store.</p>
