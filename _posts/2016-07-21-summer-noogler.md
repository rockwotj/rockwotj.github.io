Today is offically the end of my "last summer break". I just got back from an amazing three day backpacking trip in Yosemite, and am now getting ready to start my career at Google! 

I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunity God gave me to relax and enjoy life before I started work. I started out by travelling across the USA with three of my college
roommates. We went from Yellowstone, the Oregon Coast, Crater Lake, all the way to San Franciso. Super happy I was able to spend some good time with these guys after
graduation, especially since they will be living in the Midwest and I won't get to see them very often now. After that trip was finished, my girlfriend and I travelled back to
Central Oregon to spend some quality time with my family and experience the Crooked River Roundup. I then travelled back to Indiana to see another roommate marry his best friend,
and upon my return I went to Tracktown, USA to watch the Track & Field Olympic Trials. Capping my summer off was the backpacking trip with some of my friends from high school.

It was a lot, but I'm glad I did it. I'm now super ready to start work on Monday. Taking a break allowed me to be more of a [boring programmer] and now I'll be able to start work 
with a clear mind. I also was able to read a book titled [The Dude's Guide to Manhood] during my summer break and it really grounded me before I start my routine at Google.
Specifically, I need to be passionate about work, but not let it define me. I also need to remember to connect on real level with the people around me, I highly encourage men 
to checkout the book. 

I hope this summer trip was a good start to true manhood, here's to hoping I can keep it up!
