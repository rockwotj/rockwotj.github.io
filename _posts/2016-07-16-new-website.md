Just launched a new [Jekyll blog], you can see the [source code] on my GitHub account. 
I'm excited to switch my website over to this format, as it makes it easier to update and a lot less headaches.

I guess you could say this is a custom theme for Jekyll, but I really just modified the examples from the
[Material Kit by Creative Tim]. This is a pretty awesome _free_ bootstrap based frontend frameworks, that 
it inspired me to switch my website over to it. After working on it for about a full day, I'm happy with the end result
that the website turned out to be. In addition, I can now blog about stuff when it is on my mind! Whoo :)

I've also decided to add a disclaimer at the bottom. It seems to be a good idea, and the cool thing to do.
